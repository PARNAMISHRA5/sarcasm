# Depression Detection using Deep Learning with Emoji Integration

This project aims to detect depression from user-generated text on social media using a hybrid deep learning model. It combines sentiment-aware emoji embeddings with BERT-based language representations to improve detection accuracy, particularly in multilingual and informal settings.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Emoji sentiment analysis integrated into text features
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for contextual embedding
- Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism
- Handles multilingual data
- Early stopping and learning rate scheduling for optimal training

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
- BERT Encoder for text
- Emoji-to-score mapping based on sentiment polarity
- Concatenated features passed through BiLSTM + Attention
- Final classification using softmax output

## ðŸ“Š Results
The model demonstrates strong performance in binary classification of depressive and non-depressive content using a curated dataset of social media posts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements
Incorporate Multimodal Data: Including other forms of input such as images or videos could further improve depression detection accuracy.

Cross-lingual Adaptability: Enhance the multilingual support by incorporating additional language models tailored to specific languages.

Real-time Monitoring: Implement a system for real-time monitoring and detection of depressive posts as they are generated.
